/* There are three objects here.
 *
 *   compressorApi       The compression function table. Every entry calls
 *                       straight into a backend library such as lz4 or zstd.
 *                       Nothing else lives here: no names, no limits, no data.
 *                       Shared, constant, and never allocated.
 *   compressorConfig    What the operator asked for.
 *   compressorAlg       What callers hold. Made by newCompressor(), released by
 *                       freeCompressor(). Holds the function table, all the plain
 *                       data, and the backend's private scratch.
 *
 * An instance is immutable apart from its scratch buffer and its error code.
 * Nothing changes an instance after it is built. A CONFIG SET that touches a
 * compression setting builds a new instance and drops the old one.
 *
 * An instance belongs to one thread and is never shared. That is what keeps the
 * whole thing free of locks and atomics: each worker thread has its own, and the
 * main thread has its own for decompressing on reads. Compression dictionaries
 * are the exception and are shared on purpose, because they are read only once
 * loaded.
 *
 * The backend is picked once at startup from compression-mode and never changes
 * while the process runs. That is why a compressed frame carries no algorithm
 * tag. */
